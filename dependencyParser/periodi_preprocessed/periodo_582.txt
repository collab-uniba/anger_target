BTW  the new MultipleFormSupport is an ugly copypaste of FormSupportImpl mostly due to  the fact that _cycle is private in FormSupportImpl Making it protected saves more that 750 lines the other solution is for the subclass to also keep a copy of that field  when its passed in the contructor  still ugly

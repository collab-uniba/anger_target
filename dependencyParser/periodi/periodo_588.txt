Seems like copy-paste does NOT work directly  and you get an annoying loop when trying to open the newly pasted search (it tries to open the other connection  and remembers this making your current connection useless because it automaticly opens the connection from where you started copying the search) But if you close down Directory Studio and starting it up again  both the loop problem is gone  and the search has replaced the server information correctly so you actually can start using your newly pasted search

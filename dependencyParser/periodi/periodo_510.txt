: - to remove initDISIQueue() from next() and skipTo() (also the same in DisjunctionSumScorer()) ... this is due to this ugly  -1 position before first call  I just do not know how to get rid of it :) - to switch to Conjuction 'mode' if minNrShouldMatch kicks in.... there are already todo-s for it arround     if you think you can use it  just go ahead and include it in your patch  I am not using this for anything  just wrapped it up when you asked.

This bug is really annonying because : - RHEL 5 install version 5 of MySQL (No support on MySQL 4) - MySQL 4 is at end of his lifecycle - in JPA  it's so ugly to change our code from boolean to int - a search in google 'MySQL 5 boolean BIT problem' shows so many desesperate people - credibility of jboss : this bug is so annoying that my team doesn't understand that it could be possible they are afraid that it could have   other ugly bugs..
